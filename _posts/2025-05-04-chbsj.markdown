This report provides an overview of our activities and accomplishments related to the creation of reusable RDM
(Research Data Management) Planning Environments for trainings and workshops conducted during the ELIXIR BioHackathon
Europe 2024. ELIXIR recognizes the critical role of effective data management planning in enabling sustainable and
reproducible research outcomes. This effectiveness is achieved through the use of appropriate Data Management
Planning tools, such as the Data Stewardship Wizard. The Data Stewardship Wizard is used to conduct various trainings
which require instance with data which are different for each training. Goal of this project was to provide easy and
effective way to prepare “recipes” for DSW Data Seeder
